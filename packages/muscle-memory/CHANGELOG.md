# Changelog

All notable changes to `@letta-ai/muscle-memory`. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this mod is pre-1.0, so the API may still change.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **n=1 CREATE gate** (`multiInstanceSupport`, wired into the reflect lane) — a reflect-lane CREATE must
  be topically grounded in an evidence signal observed **≥2 distinct instances** (count or conversation
  spread). The aggregate items floor was not enough: an n=1 repair could ride in on an unrelated recurring
  workflow and become a command-shaped skill (live receipt: `recovering-from-npx-failures`, "Observed 1×
  across 1 session", created twice on consecutive days and retired twice). Parked creates never block a
  pattern permanently — a second observed instance changes the evidence signature and re-opens the route.
- **Structured evidence signals** — `buildCrossConversationEvidence` now returns `signals[]` (per-signal
  `label`/`kind`/`count`/`convs`) alongside the prose digest, so create-gates count instances instead of
  guessing from text.
- **Staged shelf in the CREATE dedupe surface** (`createDedupeSurface`) — manual `create` and
  `create_from_candidate` now dedupe against agent + global + **staged** shelves, so a near-duplicate of a
  not-yet-graduated skill routes to PATCH instead of spraying siblings.
- **Retired-skill quarantine in `dedupCheck`** — near-duplicates of *retired* skills under a **different
  name** are refused with a restore/absorb hint (`retiredSkillBlocker` already caught same-name recreates;
  this catches renamed clones).
- **`test/create-gates.test.ts`** — deterministic regression suite for the duplicate-create class: the
  n=1 hole, instance borrowing from unrelated signals, ungrounded creates, staged-sibling dedupe, and
  retired-clone quarantine.

### Changed
- **Hermetic reflect-lane testing** — `runReflectiveReview` now accepts injectable `dirs`/`stagedDir`
  (same pattern as `experience`). The n=1 wiring test previously scanned the HOST's real skill shelves
  (`~/.letta/skills`): on a populated machine the ambiguous-route guard fired before the n=1 gate and
  the test failed — green only on an empty shelf. The test now pins empty tmp shelves.
- **`HIGH_SIGNAL_TOOL_SET` is configuration, not hardcoded vocabulary** — the shipped set contained
  deployment-specific tool names from the authors' own rigs. It now defaults to empty and is populated
  via `MM_HIGH_SIGNAL_TOOLS` (comma-separated tool names); configured tools get a stable arg-shape
  fingerprint template. The per-tool template special-cases for those private tools were removed.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-28

The "skill library that maintains itself" release. Observe → distill/update → quality-gate → graduate →
preflight → publish → prune, end to end, with receipts.

### Added
- **SOTA quality gate** (`sotaQualityGaps`) — proves a distilled skill is top-tier (concrete symptoms,
  diagnostic TELLs, safe-first procedure, verification), not just structurally valid. Regenerates sub-SOTA drafts.
- **Library audit** (`/muscle-memory audit`) — scores every skill in the library and flags what to upgrade.
- **Cross-shelf duplicate detection** — flags the same skill name diverging across the agent + global shelves
  (the anti-bloat the audit used to silently skip).
- **Publish supply chain** — `/muscle-memory publish` preflight (publishability score + tier), `publish stage`
  (sanitized review copy + provenance metadata), `publish approve` (promote to shared Custom Skills with a
  tamper guard), plus a best-effort live `letta skills list` visibility receipt. Never auto-publishes by default.
- **Adaptive distillation depth** — diversity-scaled directive + retry-enforced Pitfalls/Worked-examples so
  distilled skills carry concrete, breadth-preserving worked examples.

### Changed
- **Modular source** — split the single `mods/index.ts` into 9 layered single-responsibility modules
  (`core ← detect ← gate/publish/engram/lifecycle ← autopilot ← index`). Behavior-preserving; the package
  ships the source modules and the Letta CLI bundles them on load.
- **Intentional public API** — the surface is the mod entry plus a `__mm` test object, not every internal symbol.

### Fixed
- Security scanner no longer hard-blocks legitimate destructive workflow ops (e.g. `git push --force-with-lease`);
  safety for those is the SAFE-FIRST quality gate's job, which unblocked distilling git/deploy skills.
- Diverse failures of one class no longer collapse to a single fingerprint (worked-example cap raised).

### Packaging
- Hero GIF removed from the npm tarball (~1.2 MB → ~108 KB); it lives in the repo/README only.
- Declared `engines.node >= 20` and explicit `dependencies: {}` (zero runtime dependencies).

### Verification
- `npm run verify`: 41 unit tests + 5-axis bench + 150-seed eval + full-lifecycle demo, all green.
